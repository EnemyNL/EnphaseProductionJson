# EnphaseProductionJson
Python script reading Enphase envoy and storing wNow production in MySQL

This python script connects (when configured properly) to your Enphase Envoy to read current production and store it in MYSQL. 

Input your data in line 12, 37, 38, 39, 49 and 57.

Works for me with firmware D5.0.62
